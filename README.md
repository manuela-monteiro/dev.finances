This is a simple frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) for a simple personal financial system, wich does not have a database, but stores all the necessary data on the browser local storage. Its functionalities are very simple, given that the main focus is to practice HTML 5 and CSS 3.

Feel free to clone the repository and use it as you will, as well as contact me with suggestions of improvements (code, functionalities, design etc.) or even ask me anything that is not clear.

Thank you for passing by!
